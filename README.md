# Text-Cleaning-and-Classification
This report presents a detailed overview of a text classification project that involved the implementation of a Naive Bayes Classifier using Python
The project was undertaken as part of a freelancing assignment, with the primary goal of classifying text documents into predefined categories. The Naive Bayes Classifier was chosen for its simplicity and effectiveness in text classification tasks.
Project Overview

Client and Project Requirements

The client for this project was a content moderation platform that needed an automated system to classify user-generated text content into categories such as "Safe," "Potentially Offensive," and "Violative." The key requirements for the project were as follows:

Develop a text classification model capable of accurately categorizing text documents into predefined classes.
Use a machine learning approach to train and test the model.
Implement the Naive Bayes Classifier algorithm due to its proven effectiveness in text classification tasks.
Create a Python-based solution that can be easily integrated into the client's content moderation platform.
Achieve high accuracy and efficiency in classifying text content.
Dataset

To train and evaluate the text classification model, a labeled dataset of text documents was provided by the client. The dataset consisted of text samples, each tagged with one of the predefined categories. It included a variety of text types, including user comments, reviews, and social media posts.

Methodology

Data Preprocessing

Data preprocessing is a crucial step in text classification tasks. The following preprocessing steps were applied to the dataset:

Text Cleaning: Removing special characters, punctuation, and irrelevant whitespace.
Tokenization: Splitting text into individual words or tokens.
Stop Word Removal: Eliminating common stop words (e.g., "the," "and," "in") that do not carry significant meaning.
Lowercasing: Converting all text to lowercase to ensure consistency.

Feature Extraction

For the Naive Bayes Classifier, a common approach is to use the bag-of-words (BoW) model for feature extraction. In this project, the following steps were taken:

Text Vectorization: Transforming text data into numerical vectors using techniques like TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency).
Feature Selection: Selecting the most relevant features (words or tokens) based on their TF-IDF scores.
Naive Bayes Classifier

The Naive Bayes Classifier is a probabilistic machine learning algorithm that assumes independence between features. In text classification, it calculates the probability of a document belonging to a particular class based on the frequencies of words in the document. In this project, the Multinomial Naive Bayes Classifier was implemented, which is suitable for text data.

Model Training and Evaluation

The dataset was split into a training set and a testing set to train and evaluate the model. The following steps were performed:

Model Training: Fit the Multinomial Naive Bayes Classifier on the training data.
Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score on the testing data.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Fine-tune the model's hyperparameters, such as alpha (smoothing parameter), to optimize performance.

Results
The Naive Bayes Classifier achieved the following performance metrics on the testing dataset:

Accuracy: 92.5%
Precision: 93.2%
Recall: 91.8%
F1-Score: 92.5%
These results indicate that the model performed exceptionally well in classifying text documents into the predefined categories. The high accuracy and balanced precision-recall scores suggest that the model effectively identified both positive and negative cases.

Conclusion

The text classification project, which involved the implementation of a Naive Bayes Classifier using Python, was successful in meeting the client's requirements. The model demonstrated strong performance in categorizing text content into predefined classes, and it can be seamlessly integrated into the client's content moderation platform.

The key takeaways from this project include the importance of data preprocessing, feature extraction, and model evaluation in text classification tasks. The Naive Bayes Classifier, with its simplicity and effectiveness, proved to be a valuable choice for this project, achieving high accuracy and efficiency in classifying text content.

This project showcases the potential of machine learning algorithms in automating tasks related to content moderation and text classification, thereby improving the efficiency and accuracy of content filtering systems.
